# Wait for cloud-config.service which runs runcmd
# Timeline:
# 1. cloud-init.service (init stage): ca_certs writes cert + creates symlinks
# 2. cloud-config.service (config stage): runcmd appends cert to bundle file
#    (workaround for Ubuntu 24.04 bug where ca_certs doesn't update bundle)
# 3. Docker starts with CA bundle containing our cert
