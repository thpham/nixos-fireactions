# Example secrets structure for sops-nix
# DO NOT commit actual secrets - this is just a template
#
# To create your encrypted secrets.yaml:
# 1. Copy this file: cp secrets.yaml.example secrets.yaml
# 2. Edit with sops: sops secrets.yaml
# 3. Replace the placeholders with your actual values
#
# The file will be encrypted automatically when you save and exit

# GitHub App ID (get from GitHub App settings page)
github_app_id: "123456"

# GitHub App private key (PEM format)
# Get this from: GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > GitHub Apps > Your App > Private keys

# Debug SSH key for VM access (optional, used by dev profile)
# This public key will be injected into Firecracker VMs for debugging access
# Generate with: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "fireactions-debug"

# Gitea API token for fireteact (Gitea Actions runner orchestrator)
# Get this from: Gitea > User Settings > Applications > Generate New Token
#
# SECURITY: Choose the most restrictive scope that meets your needs!
#
# Recommended scopes (in order of preference):
#   1. "repo" scope (most secure) - write:repository
#      - Runners only for a single repository
#      - Minimal blast radius if token is compromised
#
#   2. "org" scope (recommended default) - write:organization
#      - Runners for all repos in one organization
#      - Good balance of security and flexibility
#
#   3. "instance" scope (AVOID in production) - admin access required!
#      - Global runners for entire Gitea instance
#      - HIGH RISK: Token compromise = full instance access
#
# The token is used to dynamically request per-runner registration tokens
gitea_api_token: "your-gitea-api-token-here"

# Gitea instance URL
# The URL of your Gitea instance (e.g., https://gitea.example.com)
gitea_instance_url: "https://gitea.example.com"

# Gitea runner owner (organization name)
# Required for "org" and "repo" scope
# For "org" scope: the organization that will own the runners
# For "repo" scope: the owner of the repository
gitea_runner_owner: "my-organization"

# Gitea runner repository (optional, for "repo" scope only)
# Required when runnerScope is "repo"
# The repository where runners will be registered
gitea_runner_repo: "my-repo"
